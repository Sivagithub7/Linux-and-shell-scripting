LINUX
=======

> It was initially released by Linus Torvalds on September 17, 1991.
> Linux is open source
> It is like windows,mac,android,etc.
> Linux is considered to be more secure than windows as it is less susceptible to viruses and malware.
> It consists of 3 parts: Kernal, Shell and Programs.
> An OS is software that enables communication b/w computer hardware and software.
> Linux kernal is the core part of OS. It establish commuication b/w devices and software.
 Process management
 Memory management
 Hardware device drivers
 Filesystem drivers
 Network management
 Various other bits and pieces

>>Imp things to remember in linux:

> Linux has super user account called root.
> Root is the most powerful account that can create, modify,delete accounts and make changes to system configurations files
> Case sensitive
> Avoid using spaces when creating files and directories.
> Linux is mostly command line interface
> Linux is very flexible as compared to other os.
		
>> Advantages: 

> It is also used to perdorm to run desktop, servers and embedded systems.
> Pen source: Its source code is easily available.
> security
> free
> stability
> performance
> flexibility

>> Disadvantages of Linux:

>It is not very user-friendly. So, it may be confusing for beginners.
> The commands in UNIX is much more difficult than commands in Windows MS-DOS and macOS


> Around 600 + Linux Distributions are available and some of the popular Linux distributions are: 

MX Linux
Manjaro
Linux Mint
elementary
Ubuntu
Debian
Solus
Fedora
openSUSE
Deepin

>> Kernel: Kernel is the core of the Linux based operating system.
> It virtualizes the common hardware resources of the computer to provide each process with its virtual resources.

>> Shell: 
> It is a program that takes keyboard and gives OS to perform.
>It is an interface to the kernel which hides the complexity of the kernel’s functions from the users.
> It takes commands from the user and executes the kernel’s functions.

>> Terminal:
> (Tool) we can use to pass shell commands.

>> Why Linux is cheaper than Windows?
Linux is an open source software and some versions can be downloaded free, 
whereas Windows is a closed source (premium) software with a paid subscription.

>>Inside Linux

 Kernel 
o The core of the UNIX system. Loaded at system start up (boot). Memory-resident control 
program. 
o Manages the entire resources of the system, presenting them to you and every other user 
as a coherent system. Provides service to user applications such as device management, 
process scheduling, etc. 
 
 Shell 
o Whenever you login to a Unix system you are placed in a shell program. The shell's 
prompt is usually visible at the cursor's position on your screen. To get your work done, 
you enter commands at this prompt. 

o Different users may use different shells. Initially, your system adminstrator will supply a 
default shell, which can be overridden or changed. The most commonly available shells 
are: 
 Bourne shell (sh) 
 C shell (csh) 
 Korn shell (ksh) 
 TC Shell (tcsh) 
 Bourne Again Shell (bash) 
o Each shell also includes its own programming language. Command files, called "shell 
scripts" are used to accomplish a series of tasks. 

 Utilities 
o UNIX provides several hundred utility programs, often referred to as commands. 
o Accomplish universal functions 
 editing 
 file maintenance 
 printing 
 sorting 
 programming support 
 online info etc. 
o Modular: single functions can be grouped to perform more complex tasks

>>What is virtual memory?
Linux supports virtual memory, that is, using a disk as an extension of RAM so that the effective size of 
usable memory grows correspondingly.
