LINUX
=======

> Linux is a community of open-source Unix like operating systems that are based on the Linux Kernel.
> It was initially released by Linus Torvalds on September 17, 1991. It is a free and open-source operating system and the source code can be modified and distributed to anyone commercially or noncommercially under the GNU General Public License. 
> Linux is open source
> It is like windows,mac,android,etc.
> Linux is considered to be more secure than windows as it is less susceptible to viruses and malware.
> It consists of 3 parts: Kernal, Shell and Programs.
> An OS is software that enables communication b/w computer hardware and software.
> Linux kernal is the core part of OS. It establish commuication b/w devices and software.
. Device management
. Memory management
. Process management

Kernal:

process 1      process 2       process 3

>> Advantages: 

> It is also used to perdorm to run desktop, servers and embedded systems.
> Pen source: Its source code is easily available.
> security
> free
> stability
> performance
> flexibility

>> Disadvantages of Linux:

>It is not very user-friendly. So, it may be confusing for beginners.
> The commands in UNIX is much more difficult than commands in Windows MS-DOS and macOS


> Around 600 + Linux Distributions are available and some of the popular Linux distributions are: 

MX Linux
Manjaro
Linux Mint
elementary
Ubuntu
Debian
Solus
Fedora
openSUSE
Deepin

>> Kernel: Kernel is the core of the Linux based operating system.
> It virtualizes the common hardware resources of the computer to provide each process with its virtual resources.

>> Shell: 
> It is a program that takes keyboard and gives OS to perform.
>It is an interface to the kernel which hides the complexity of the kernel’s functions from the users.
> It takes commands from the user and executes the kernel’s functions.

>> Terminal:
> (Tool) we can use to pass shell commands.

>> Why Linux is cheaper than Windows?
Linux is an open source software and some versions can be downloaded free, 
whereas Windows is a closed source (premium) software with a paid subscription.
