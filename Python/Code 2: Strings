Use what you know about the print() function to print out the phrase "Hello World" . Make sure your capitalization and spacing match.

sol:
print("Hellow World")
--------------------------------------------------
#String indexing:
Write a string index that returns just the letter 'r'  from 'Hello World' .
For example, 'Hello World'[0]  returns 'H' 
You should only write one line of code for this. Do not assign a variable name to the string.

sol:
'Hello World'[8]
---------------------------------------------
#String Slicing
Use string slicing to grab the word 'ink'  from inside 'tinker' 
For example, 'education'[3:6]  returns 'cat' 
Remember that when slicing you only go up to but not including the end index.
You should only write one line of code for this. Do not assign a variable name to the string.

sol:
'tinker'[1:4]
