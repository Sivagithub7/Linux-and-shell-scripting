Write a program that adds the digits in a 2 digit number. e.g. if the input was 35, then the output should be 3 + 5 = 8

Warning. Do not change the code on line 1. Your program should work for different inputs. e.g. any two-digit number.

The last line of your program should print the result.

Example 1 Input
39

Example 1 Output
12

ans:

two_digit_number = input()
# ðŸš¨ Don't change the code above ðŸ‘†
####################################
# Write your code below this line ðŸ‘‡
first_input=int(two_digit_number[0])
second_input=int(two_digit_number[2])
two_digit_number=first_input+second_input
print(two_digit_number)

note : index represents which number to take.

> ** -->exponents
()--> parantheses

> NOTE: You should convert the bmi to a whole number and print out a whole number in order to pass all the tests. See examples below.

Example Input 1
1.75
80
means: weight = 80 and height = 1.75

Example Output 1
26
Since: 80 Ã· (1.75 x 1.75) = 26.122448979591837

> Number manipulation and f strings:

score=0
height=1.8
isWinning=True
print(f"your score is {score},your height is {height}, you are {isWinning}")

o/p:
your score is 0,your height is 1.8, you are True

> Prog:

I was reading this article by Tim Urban - Your Life in Weeks and realised just how little time we actually have.

Create a program using maths and f-Strings that tells us how many weeks we have left, if we live until 90 years old.

It will take your current age as the input and output a message with our time left in this format:

You have x weeks left.
Where x is replaced with the actual calculated number of weeks the input age has left until age 90.

Warning your output should match the Example Output format exactly, even the positions of the commas and full stops.

Example Input
56
Example Output
You have 1768 weeks left.

ans:
age = input()
# ðŸš¨ Don't change the code above ðŸ‘†
# Write your code below this line ðŸ‘‡
years=90-int(age)
weeks=years*52

print(f"you have {weeks} weeks left")

note: 52 weeks in a year

i.p:15
o/p:

you have 3900 weeks left
