If:The if statement evaluates condition . If condition is evaluated to True , the code inside the body of if is executed. If condition is evaluated to False , the code inside the body of if is skipped

ex:
print("results")

marks=35

if marks>=35:
    print("you passed")
else:
    print("you failed")

o/p: you passed    

>print("welcome to the rollercoaster!")
height = int(input("what is your height in cm? "))
if height >= 120:
    print("you can go")
else:
    print("you can not go")

o/p:

what is your height in cm? 110
you can not go

>e.g. 86 is even because 86 Ã· 2 = 43

43 does not have any decimal places. Therefore the division is clean.

e.g. 59 is odd because 59 Ã· 2 = 29.5

29.5 is not a whole number, it has decimal places. Therefore there is a remainder of 0.5, so the division is not clean.

The modulo is written as a percentage sign (%) in Python. It gives you the remainder after a division.

e.g.

6 Ã· 2 = 3 with no remainder.

therefore: 6 % 2 = 0

5 Ã· 2 = 2 x 2 + 1, remainder is 1.

therefore: 5 % 2 = 1

14 Ã· 4 = 3 x 4 + 2, remainder is 2.

therefore: 14 % 4 = 2

Warning your output should match the Example Output format exactly, even the positions of the commas and full stops.

Example 1 Input
43
Example 1 Output
This is an odd number.
Example 2 Input
94
Example 2 Output
This is an even number.

sol:

#Â Which number do you want to check?
number = int(input())
# ğŸš¨ Don't change the code above ğŸ‘†

# Write your code below this line ğŸ‘‡
if number%2==0:
  print("even number")
else:
  print("odd number")

i.p:
43
o/p:
odd number
 -----------------------------------------------------------------
 elif:In Python, elif is short for "else if" and is used when the first if statement isn't true, but you want to check for another condition.
 
print("results")

marks=35

if marks==35:
    print("you are promoted")
elif marks>35:
    print("you are passed")
else:
    print("you failed")
    
 o/p:
 results
you are promoted

ex:
print("results")

marks=38

if marks==35:
    print("you are promoted")
elif marks>35:
    print("you are passed")
else:
    print("you failed")

o/p:
results
you are passed

age=int(input("what is your age: "))
if age < 12:
    print("pay $5")
elif age <= 18:
    print("pay $10")
else:
    print("pay $15")

o/p:

what is your age: 13
pay $10

what is your age: 19
pay $15

Nestedif:The nested if statements in Python are the nesting of an if statement inside another if statement with or without an else statement

print("results")
marks=96

if marks==35:
    print("you are promoted")
elif marks>35:
    print("you are passed")
    if marks>75:
        print("good marks ",marks)
    elif marks>85:
        print("great marks ", marks)
    elif marks>95:
        print("top marks ", marks)
else:
    print("you failed")

o/p:

results
you are passed
good marks  96

now i will change it because i t is greater than 95

print("results")
marks=96

if marks==35:
    print("you are promoted")
elif marks>35:
    print("you are passed")
    if marks>75 and marks<85:
        print("good marks ",marks)
    elif marks>85 and marks<95:
        print("great marks ", marks)
    elif marks>95:
        print("top marks ", marks)
else:
    print("you failed")
    
 o/p:
 
 results
you are passed
top marks  96

ex:

print("results")
marks=70

if marks==35:
    print("you are promoted")
elif marks>35:
    print("you are passed")
    if marks>75 and marks<85:
        print("good marks ",marks)
    elif marks>85 and marks<95:

    elif marks>95:
        print("top marks ", marks)
    else:
        print("better luck next time")
else:
    print("you failed")

o/p
results
you are passed
better luck next time
