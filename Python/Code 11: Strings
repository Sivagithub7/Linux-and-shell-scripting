Use what you know about the print() function to print out the phrase "Hello World" . Make sure your capitalization and spacing match.

sol:
print("Hellow World")
--------------------------------------------------
#String indexing:
Write a string index that returns just the letter 'r'  from 'Hello World' .
For example, 'Hello World'[0]  returns 'H' 
You should only write one line of code for this. Do not assign a variable name to the string.

sol:
'Hello World'[8]
---------------------------------------------
#String Slicing
Use string slicing to grab the word 'ink'  from inside 'tinker' 
For example, 'education'[3:6]  returns 'cat' 
Remember that when slicing you only go up to but not including the end index.
You should only write one line of code for this. Do not assign a variable name to the string.

sol:
'tinker'[1:4]
--------------------------------------
Print Formatting
Write an expression using any of the string formatting methods we have learned (except f-strings, see note below) to return the phrase 'Python rules!' 

For example, these phrases both return 'I like apples' :

'I like %s' %'apples'
'I like {}'.format('apples')
Your solution should be entered on one line. You can not use variable names, only the strings themselves.

NOTE: At this time, f-strings won't work! Udemy Coding Exercises use Python 3.5.2, and f-strings require Python 3.6 or higher.

sol:

'{} {}'.format('Python', 'rules!')
